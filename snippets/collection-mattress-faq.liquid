                    A mattress topper can make a big difference in the comfort of your bed. If your mattress is too firm or too soft, a topper can help create a more comfortable sleep surface. In addition, if you have any pain in your back or hips, a topper can help to provide extra support and relief. There are various types of mattress toppers available, so it is essential to choose one that will work well with your specific type of mattress.

                </h3>
                <div class="globalcustomdropdowncontent animateout">
                    A mattress topper is an extra layer of material that is placed on top of a mattress to improve its comfort and support. It is typically made from foam or fibre and can also help extend a mattress's lifespan by protecting it from wear and tear. Many people find that adding a foam mattress topper makes their bed more comfortable and allows them to sleep better.

                    Adding a mattress topper can transform an uncomfortable mattress into a cosy haven for sleep. It can reduce the pressure on a mattress, preventing sagging that would usually occur. If you’re dissatisfied with the firmness level of your mattress, a foam mattress topper can make it feel plush and comfortable.

                    How do I wash or clean a mattress topper from Super Sleeper Pro?
                </h3>
                <div class="globalcustomdropdowncontent animateout">
                <p>Following the care instructions when washing your foam mattress topper is essential. To maximise its lifespan, you should only wash the removable outer cover. Before the first use, put it in the washing machine on cold and line or hang dry only.</p>
                <p>For detailed washing instructions and tips, please refer to our comprehensive <a href="https://supersleeperpro.com.au/blogs/sleep-research/how-to-clean-a-mattress-topper">washing guide</a>.</p>
                <p>Remember that you should wash dark colours separately, and only machine wash in a gentle setting. Avoid tumble drying, bleaching and using fabric softeners to damage the fabric. To remove wrinkles, iron them on medium heat. Lastly, we don’t recommend dry cleaning your mattress topper's cover with trichloroethylene.</p>
