That's why we offer a free, 120-night at-home trial from the day your mattress arrives.<br\/><br\/>While we are confident you'll fall in love with your new mattress, rest assured that if you aren't completely satisfied with your mattress within the 120-night trial, you can return this back to us for a refund. In order to receive a full refund from your trial period, please make sure to use your mattress protector, which we supply with all mattress purchases. This is to help prevent moisture, body sweat, oils, and spilt liquids from causing the build-up of bacteria or mould on the mattress.<br\/><br\/>We recommend giving your body at least 30 days to adjust adequately to the new mattress before deciding to return. If after seven days you aren't enjoying the comfort and support of the Rest and Reform Mattress, we're happy to provide you with one free comfort adjustment to change the level of firmness. Please See My Comfort Adjustment below for further details.<br\/><br\/>On the unlikely chance you're still unsatisfied after trying a new comfort adjustment, and you have given your body 30 days to adapt, we're happy to provide a full refund. Simply contact us and we will organise for your mattress to be collected free of charge and a full refund will be processed once we receive the mattress back in good condition.<br\/><br\/>*Please keep in mind that we limit returns under the 120-night trial to one item, per order, per household. We suggest that you purchase one to begin with and if you are happy, to then place a further order for more.<\/p>","page":""}},"template--14627195945031__d6668d7a-4152-412c-8b5c-32f3e943674b-collapsible_row-2":{"type":"collapsible_row","settings":{"heading":"How do I return my mattress?","icon":"check_mark","row_content":"<p>If you are not satisfied before the conclusion of the 120-night trial period, please contact us at <strong>+61 2 9387 4100<\/strong> or email us at <strong>enquiries@supersleeperpro.com.au<\/strong> to obtain refund approval from the MyMattress team.
