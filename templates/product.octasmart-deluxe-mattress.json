Its open-cell design allows for advanced airflow and cooling comfort for an extraordinary night's sleep with our OCTAsmart® Essentials mattress topper range. Octacell™ is a unique comfort innovation inspired by Octaspring® aerospace technology; our eight-sided patented foam spring that blends the comfort of foam and the responsiveness of a spring in a new technology now recognised as the best new comfort innovation in Aerospace. It has been used in OCTAsmart® and OCTAsmart® Luxury mattress toppers, and now our experts have reimagined it again for our OCTAsmart® Essentials collection, creating an Octacell™ comfort layer which provides the same level of essential comfort and support as the original technology, but with less material. The power of Octacell™ means that there are thousands of individual support points in the mattress topper, which practically work as individual zones, creating perfect support for your body. Thanks to the 10,000 individual support cells of our innovative Octacell™ technology, we have developed a mattress topper that responds instinctively with your body to support you and help avoid any unnecessary transfer of movement if you or your partner are restless sleepers.<\/p>","page":""}},"9a390226-91b4-437c-9ca5-30665a2631c7":{"type":"collapsible_row","settings":{"heading":"Is The Octasmart® Mattress Environmentally Friendly?","icon":"check_mark","row_content":"<p>Our Essentials mattress are probably one of the eco-friendliest mattress toppers we have designed.
